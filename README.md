This repository contains user interface code developed by Team ViGIR. The 3D user
interface uses [rviz](https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz) as a
backend. Due to modifications required for some advanced features that had to be done
to the rviz code base, the [vigir_rviz](https://github.com/team-vigir/vigir_rviz)
fork is currently required.
